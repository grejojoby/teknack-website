## About Us
### Training and Guidance

### Unity Development
The games are developed using the Unity Engine. Developers get hands-on experience on the platform through their journey of development.

### Gaming Events and Fests
We also host an annual fest named "Teknack" every year and during this fest, the games are published on Google Play Store and various awards are declared for the developers. Also we keep gaming events as part of the fest to inculcate a gaming culture.
